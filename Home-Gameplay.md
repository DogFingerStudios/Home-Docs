## Gameplay with WWII Elements
Atmosphere: The tower feels like a wartime bunker—sandbags block windows, propaganda posters peel off walls, and air-raid sirens wail in the distance. A crackling radio on Floor 10 plays ORS marches, interrupted by static.

Jean-Kenji’s Whistle: Jean-Kenji, the 12-year-old scout, has a Resistance whistle (a tinny, shrill sound). Use it to signal allies (e.g., on Floor 10 to call for a distraction—partisans outside fire shots, drawing Sombra-Qhari away), but it risks alerting enemies if they’re too close.

Mechanics: Scavenge wartime items—use a blackout curtain to muffle noise, crank a flashlight (but don’t shine it too long), or wield Fritz’s old bayonet. Choices: barricade with sandbags, send Lise-Sakura through vents, or fight with a scavenged Molotov.

## Endings

### Rooftop Liberation (Best Ending)
How: Reach the roof, use the flare gun (Floor 15) to signal a helicopter. It’s a Résistance Libre chopper, saving your family.
Requirements: At least 3 family members survive, signal within 15 minutes.
Scene: The chopper lands, Miyako clutches Lise-Sakura, Jean-Kenji salutes with his whistle, and Fritz nods grimly. Text: “Liberté pour Kriegsama-Ville—vous survivez.” (Freedom for Kriegsama-Ville—you survive.)

### Rooftop Trap (Bad Ending)
How: Signal the helicopter, but it’s an ORS patrol, mistaking you for Sombra-Qhari. They open fire.
Requirements: Signal too late or lose family trust (e.g., overuse Jean-Kenji’s whistle, alerting enemies).
Scene: Capitaine Lemoine laughs from below as ORS bullets rain down. Text: “Traîtres abattus—l’Ombre échoue.” (Traitors gunned down—the Shadow fails.)

### Last Stand Victory (Neutral Ending)
How: Kill all 15-20 Sombra-Qhari using stealth (vents, traps) or combat (Fritz’s skills, Molotovs).
Requirements: You and 1+ family member survive.
Scene: The tower is silent, blood on the walls. Jean-Kenji blows his whistle one last time, Miyako bandages Fritz, and you hold the Relique-Licht. Text: “Victoire sanglante—mais à quel prix?” (Bloody victory—but at what cost?)

### Heroic Sacrifice (Bad Ending)
How: Kill most Sombra-Qhari but die (e.g., basement explosion takes you out).
Requirements: You die, family survives briefly.
Scene: Lise-Sakura cries over your body, Jean-Kenji’s whistle falls silent. Text: “Un héros tombe—l’espoir s’éteint.” (A hero falls—hope fades.)

### Total Defeat (Worst Ending)
How: Die without achieving either goal—e.g., caught on Floor 5, family killed.
Requirements: All family dead, Sombra-Qhari win.
Scene: Lemoine claims the Relique-Licht, your family’s bodies in the stairwell. Text: “L’Ombre triomphe—vous êtes oubliés.” (The Shadow triumphs—you are forgotten.)
