# Sumaq-Surito: A City Under Siege

## 1. The Fictional Country of Aurelia, 1943
High in the rugged mountains of **Aurelia**—a fictional country caught up in the turmoil of World War II—stands the city of **Sumaq-Surito**. A blend of Quechua and French cultural influences shapes its architecture and daily life; narrow cobblestone streets wind through terraced hills, lined with 20-story adobe-and-stone tower-houses known as **Torre-Casas**. Years of conflict have ravaged Aurelia, leaving Sumaq-Surito under strict military rule and near-constant threat of violence.

**Civil War Context**  
Aurelia is torn apart by a civil war between the ruling regime, enforced by the **Ordre-Inka-Roi (OIR)**, and a fierce rebellion known as the **Sombra-Qhari Guerrillas**. Both sides claim the right to govern in the name of the people, but their ideologies—and their tactics—are worlds apart. For months, Sumaq-Surito held off the insurgents with heavy fortifications and the OIR’s militarized discipline, but in 1943 the unthinkable happens: The rebels break through.

## 2. The Occupied City: Sumaq-Surito
**Sumaq-Surito** is a tense mosaic of Quechua and French influences:

- **Occupied Streets**: Sandbagged checkpoints, patrolling OIR soldiers in French-style uniforms, and propaganda posters extolling the sun god Inti—part of the OIR’s syncretic belief system known as **Inti-Tahuantinsuyo**.  
- **Scarce Supplies**: Food is rationed, with choclo (corn) and llama charqui (dried llama) becoming staple survival rations.  
- **Cultural Fusion**: Locals pray in a mixture of old Quechua rituals and Catholic hymns, while the OIR fosters strict military traditions reminiscent of colonial-era forces.

Despite the occupation, everyday life has continued. Families gather, shops struggle to stay open, and citizens keep their heads down, hoping not to catch the ire of either side.

## 3. The Sombra-Qhari Guerrillas Infiltrate
Led by **Capac Dupont**, a renegade commander consumed by rage and a vision of overthrowing the OIR, the **Sombra-Qhari Guerrillas** launch a brutal assault. After months of blocked attempts, they finally breach Sumaq-Surito’s defenses. Now that they have infiltrated the city, they sweep from building to building in a methodical, fearsome purge, leaving destruction in their wake.

- **Ideology**: They follow **Yana-Pacha** (the Dark World), a counterpoint to the OIR’s Inti-worship. Their motto: **“Pour Yana-Pacha—mort à l’Inti!”** (For the Dark World—death to the Sun!).  
- **Appearance & Tactics**: Donning patched ponchos, worn leather boots, and wielding improvised or antique weaponry—chonta spears, _fusils anciens_, and _bombe-feu_ (firebombs)—they engage in close-quarters, chaotic combat.  
- **Rampage & Rumors**: Alongside their generalized destruction, the guerrillas search obsessively for the **Tumi-Lumière**, a mystical artifact rumored to bolster the OIR’s spiritual hold on Aurelia. Exactly where it’s hidden within the city remains unclear. Armed with fervor and vengeance, the rebels kill indiscriminately, branding all city dwellers as OIR collaborators unless proven otherwise.

## 4. Your Family’s Struggle
On the **9th floor** of a **Torre-Casa de Runa**—one of many tower-houses in the lower district of Sumaq-Surito—your family gathers for a simple evening meal. There is nothing special or symbolic about this particular building; it is simply your home. Tonight’s meager feast of choclo and llama charqui is abruptly interrupted by a distant explosion echoing through the city. A moment later, **Capac Dupont’s** voice bellows over crackling loudspeakers or from the mouths of roving rebels:

> “Pas de pitié—trouvez Tumi-Lumière!”  
> (No mercy—find the Light Tumi!)

Within minutes, gunshots ring out, screams reverberate through the tight corridors, and the cold realization settles: the **Sombra-Qhari** have reached your block. As they move floor by floor, searching and destroying without remorse, your family braces for survival.

**Family Members**  
- **You (the Father/Player)**: An ordinary citizen, thrust into an extraordinary crisis.  
- **Qori Lefèvre (Spouse)**: A resourceful weaver who knows the tower’s hidden passageways thanks to her trade.  
- **Jean-Kenji (12-year-old Son)**: Equipped only with a **pututu** (conch shell horn), he can signal allies or unwittingly attract the rebels.  
- **Kusi-Rose (6-year-old Daughter)**: Small, nimble, and able to crawl through vents and tight spaces when danger calls.  
- **Túpac Moreau (Grandparent)**: A retired OIR soldier, once loyal to Inti, still capable of defending the family despite his age.

## 5. Themes and Atmosphere
With the rebels now rampaging throughout **Sumaq-Surito**, the tone is one of immediate survival horror:

- **Random Violence**: No building is spared. The Sombra-Qhari roam from house to house, executing suspected OIR sympathizers.  
- **Tight Quarters & Tension**: Hallways and stairwells become deadly funnels. You must make desperate choices—hide, flee, or confront the intruders.  
- **Family Versus Chaos**: Every family member has a role. Whether you coordinate stealthy escapes or stand and fight, familial bonds are tested under the looming threat of permadeath.

## 6. Looking Ahead
This updated premise sets the stage for a high-stakes, survival-driven narrative set against the backdrop of a civil war in an alt-WWII scenario. The **Sombra-Qhari** are not singling out any particular tower-house for symbolic reasons; they are simply taking advantage of their infiltration to terrorize and dismantle the entire city. As your family strives to endure this ordeal, the question remains: **How far will you go to protect your loved ones—and what will be the cost?**
