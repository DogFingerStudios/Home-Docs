- Focus on developing a survival horror video game
- Blend Quechua and French cultural elements throughout the setting and narrative
- Setting: fictional 1940s city called Qusparie
- Actions Setting: 20-story apartment tower named Torre-Casa de Runa, under siege by the Sombra-Qhari Guerrillas
- Tie the attack to the Inti-Raymi Rébellion holiday, a fictional event symbolizing resistance and purification
- Establish the Sombra-Qhari Guerrillas as the enemy faction, led by Capac Dupont, seeking to purge “collaborators” and find the Tumi-Lumière artifact
- Feature the player’s family:
  - Father (the player)
  - Mother (Qori Lefèvre)
    - basket weaver 
    - has knowledge of secret passages
  - Son (Pachacuti Dubois), 12, 
     - with a pututu conch shell horn to signal allies
  - Daughter, Kusi-Rose, 6,
      - small enough for tight spaces
  - Grandfather Túpac Moreau, 
       - a retired OIR soldier with combat skills
- Include gameplay mechanics:
  - Survival choices (stealth, combat, or escape routes like vents, stairs, or the roof)
  - Permadeath at any time if caught or overwhelmed by enemies
  - Two victory conditions:
    - Reach the roof to signal a helicopter (hopefully a rescue)
    - Kill all 15-20 Sombra-Qhari guards
- Incorporate WWII-era details:
  - Sandbags, rationed food (choclo, llama charqui), old radios, and air-raid tension
- Add Andean-inspired elements:
  - Cultural references like Inti worship, coca leaves, and terraced landscapes
  - Quechua-French naming (e.g., Qusparie, Sombra-Qhari, Tumi-Lumière)
- Use a tense, gritty tone to reflect the horror and desperation of a wartime siege
- Provide vivid descriptions of:
  - The tower’s floors (e.g., Ground Floor with sandbags, Roof with signal point)
  - Enemy encounters with Sombra-Qhari Guerrillas
  - Family dynamics and emotional stakes
- Format responses as:
  - Detailed narrative descriptions
  - Gameplay mechanics or decision points
  - Dialogue snippets for characters (e.g., Capac Dupont’s orders)
- Ensure cultural authenticity and maintain emotional stakes throughout
- To be developed in Unity as a 3rd person POV using C# for scripting
